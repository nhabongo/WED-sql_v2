This is the initial draft of the WSQL (or WED-SQL) declarative language. Declarations presented between [] are always optional.

CREATE WED-FLOW wedflow_name [WITH PASSWORD password];

Creates a new WED-flow database a management user both identifyed by 'wedflow_name'. Although the WITH PASSWORD parameter 
is optional, it will be prompted when omitted. A manager user has the right credencials to manipulate a specific WED-flow, 
including creating external users. Every WED-flow database must have a manager user.

CREATE WED-ATTRIBUTE attr_name [DEFAULT VALUE value];

Creates a new WED-attribute identifyed by 'attr_name' with a optional default value.

CREATE WED-TRANSITION trans_name [WITH TIMEOUT time];

Creates a new WED-transition identified by 'trans_name' with a timeout of 'time'. The time parameter uses the same
notation as the postgresql type 'interval'. For example, one hour interval can be expressed as '01:00:00' or '1h'. When
omitted, the default time interval of one hour will be assumed.

CREATE WED-CONDITION cond_name WITH PREDICATE pred;

Creates a new WED-condition identified by cond_name and having pred as its predicate. 'pred' can be anything accepted by
the SQL clause WHERE;

CREATE WED-TRIGGER trg_name as (trans_name [WITH TIMEOUT timeout], cond_name [WITH PREDICATE pred])

Creates a new WED-trigger associating a WED-transition with a WED-condition. Both the transition and the condition can
be pre-defined or created on the fly when the optional parameters are present.

CREATE INSTANCE AS [DEFAULT VALUES] wed_state;

Creates a new WED-flow instance where 'wed_state' represents the initial values for the WED-attributes. When DEFAULT VALUES
is present, this instance will be created using the default values defined for the WED-atributes.

UPDATE WED-ATTRIBUTE atr_name SET DEFAULT VALUE value;

Change the default value for WED-attribute 'atr_name'

UPDATE WED-TRANSITION trans_name SET TIMEOUT timeout;

Change WED-transition trans_name's timeout.

{ENABLE | DISABLE} WED-TRIGGER trg_name;

Enable or disable a WED-trigger. When disabled, a WED-trigger will not fire a WED-transitiont even if the WED-condition
matches a new WED-state.

LIST [ENABLED | DISABLED] WED-TRIGGERS;

By default, lists all WED-triggers defined for this WED-flow.

LIST WED-ATTRIBUTES;

Lists all defined WED-attributes;

LIST WED-CONDITIONS;

Lists all defined WED-conditions;

LIST WED-TRANSITIONS;

Lists all defined WED-transitions;

LIST [PENDING | ONGOING] FIRED WED-TRANSITIONS [FOR wid];

By default, lists all fired WED-transitions for all instances. When PENDING is present, only WED-transitions awating to 
be performed are show. When ONGOING is present, only WED-transitions that are beeing executed by a WED-worker are show.
The FOR parameter can be used to specify a single instance 'wid'.

LIST [FINAL | EXCEPTION | REGULAR] INSTANCES;

By default, lists all WED-flow instance's current WED-state. Optional parameters can be used to specify what kind of instances
should be listed.

LIST HISTORY [FOR wid];

By default, displays the execution history for all WED-flow instances. The optional parameter can be used to specify a
instance. 

P.S.: Other aditional wsql tokens were intentionaly left off because I am not sure yet how to carry out some operations. For
example, how to disable or remove WED-attributes ?
