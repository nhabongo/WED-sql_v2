items to evaluate: tyres, brakes, alignment

items values: tyres -> 1 - 5 (1-unsafe, 2-bad, 3-replace, 4-good, 5-excellent)
              brakes -> 1 - 4  (1-full service, 2-disc and pads, 3-pads only, 4-good)
              alignment -> 1 - 2 (1-bad, 2-good)
              
car condition: good -> tyres > 3 and brakes = 4 and alignment = 2
               maintance -> tyres <= 3 or brakes < 4 or alignment = 1
               
in case of maintance is needed:
               tyres ? replace and align
               brakes ? service
               alignment ? check tyres first ( >= 3)
